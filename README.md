### Hi there 👋

My name is Doug and I currently work as a Leadership Recruiter at Meta. I've been recruiting for the past 8 years, primarily focused on hiring Software Engineers in the Twin Cities metro area. I am in the process of expanding my professional skills software development through the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp. Check out my repo's to see what I've been working on!
